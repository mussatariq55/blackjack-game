# 🃏 Blackjack Game — Command Line Python Project

A simple Blackjack game played against the computer using Python. This project uses core Python concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, list operations, and basic game logic to simulate a realistic game of Blackjack.

## 📌 Features

- Simulates card dealing and scoring like real Blackjack  
- Follows standard rules: Ace = 11 or 1, Face cards = 10  
- Auto-deals computer cards until it reaches 17+  
- Uses functions for modular, clean logic  
- Fun ASCII art splash to start each game 🎨  
- Clears screen for a fresh new game experience every time

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Function-based game design  
- Card simulation using list-based logic  
- Score calculations & win/loss condition handling  
- Input-driven game flow with user decisions  
- Enhancing user experience through ASCII design

Your cards: [10, 6], current score: 16  
Computer’s first card: 9  
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: y  
Your final hand: [10, 6, 5], final score: 21  
Computer’s final hand: [9, 8], final score: 17  
You win 😃
